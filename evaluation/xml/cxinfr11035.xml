that in many cases the computation done by the nervous system can
be described in machine learning terms and using information
theory. This course focusses on the more mathematical models of the
brain and sensory processing. The solutions found by the nervous
system might transfer to engineering applications such as
compression, parallel processing, and dealing with complex
data.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>It is RECOMMENDED that students have passed

only, or by special permission of the School. The background needed
to successfully take this course is a good grounding in
mathematics, particularly with regard to probability and
statistics, vectors and matrices. The mathematical level required
is similar to that which would be obtained by students who did not
have significant difficulties with the courses Mathematics for
Informatics 1-4 taken in the first two years of the Informatics
undergraduate syllabus. The Probabilistic Modelling &amp; Reasoning
(PMR) course is recommended as preparation. Also, a reasonable
level of familiarity with computational concepts and MATLAB is
assumed.</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>Yes</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester2, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday>09:00 - 09:50</Monday><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday>09:00 - 09:50</Thursday><Friday/></time></activity><first_class>Week 1, Monday, 09:00 - 09:50,

Assessment
There will be two assessed assignments, one on neural coding, one
on probabilistic models for neural information processing.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>*Neural coding: reverse correlation, higher order
