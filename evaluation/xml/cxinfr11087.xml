fundamental limits on our ability to store, process and communicate
data, whether in natural or artificial systems. Understanding and
approaching these limits is important in a wide variety of topics
in informatics.

This course covers the theory introduced by Shannon in 1948, which
revolutionized how we think about information and communication,
and some of the practical techniques for compression and reliable
communication that have been developed since.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>- A solid mathematical background is
required.
- Some general mathematical ability (at MfI 1 level) is essential:
Special functions log, exp are fundamental; mathematical notation
(such as sums) used throughout; some calculus.
- Probability theory is used extensively: Random variables,
expectation, Bernoulli trials, Binomial distribution, joint and
conditional probabilities (MfI 1&amp;4).</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>No</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester1, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday>14:10 - 15:00</Tuesday><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday>14:10 - 15:00</Friday></time></activity><activity><Location>First Class</Location><Activity>Week 1, Tuesday, 14:00 - 14:50,

- Explain the source coding and noisy channel theorems and describe
their implications for applications covered in lectures.
- Compute information theoretic quantities, construct bounds and
describe+implement algorithms involving high-dimensional
probability distributions.
- Describe the techniques covered in the course: identify their
limitations, discuss their practical merits and design and describe
alternatives.
- For a novel data source, communication channel or application,
identify relevant information theoretic aspects to provide insight
or suggest useful methods.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination: 80%
