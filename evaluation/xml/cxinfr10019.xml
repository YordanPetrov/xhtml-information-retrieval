students an understanding of the theory and practice of
large-scale, knowledge-based systems operating in an open,
distributed environment. The primary intended examples of such
systems are the Semantic Web; the semantic layer of grid based
systems; and the coordination aspects of open multi-agent
systems.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Multi-agent Semantic

theoretical models of distributed knowledge-based systems, and
assess their applicability to specific knowledge-sharing
tasks.
2 - Describe the motivations for, and effectiveness of, inference
techniques in the implementation of distributed knowledge-based
systems.
3 - Critically assess the adequacy of relevant standards (WSDL,
RDF, OWL, etc) as a basis for building practical systems.
4 - Demonstrate an understanding of how the architecture and design
of distributed knowledge-based systems interacts with wider social
and technological developments.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70
