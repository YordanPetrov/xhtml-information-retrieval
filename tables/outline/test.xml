        <td width="85%" colspan="99">This course is designed as a first
          introduction into cognitive science. It will provide a broad
          overview of the subject suitable for all interested students,
          including students on the Cognitive Science degrees and external
          students.<br />
          <br />
          The aim of the course is to present a unified view of the field,
          based on a computational approach to analyzing cognition. The
          material is presented grouped by cognitive function, rather than by
          subdiscipline.<br />
          <br />
          The course covers vision and attention, memory, motor control and
          action, reasoning and problem solving, and language. All topics
          will be presented from a computational point of view, and this
          perspective will be reinforced by a lab sessions in which students
          use implementations of cognitive models. The course will also
          provide a basic grounding in cognitive science methodology,
          focusing computational modeling, experimental design, and
          statistics. Both symbolic and subsymbolic modeling approaches will
          be covered.</td>
