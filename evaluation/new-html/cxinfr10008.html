<td width="70%">The module extends a line of study,
begun in CS3 Computability and Intractability, in which
computational problems are classified according to their intrinsic
difficulty or ``complexity.'' We formalise the notion of complexity
of a problem as the amount of time (or space) required to solve the
problem on a simple universal computing device, namely the Turing
machine. We study some fundamental features of computation in this
model, such as time and space hierarchies, the relationship between
time and space, and between determinism and non-determinism. We
introduce a number of natural complexity classes, which are
essentially independent of the Turing machine model, and
characterise these classes by identifying some of their complete
(i.e., hardest) problems. We then introduce a computational model
based on Boolean circuits that allows us to classify problems
according to their parallel complexities; as with sequential
computation, we are able to separate those problems that can be
solved efficiently on a parallel computer from those that
(apparently) cannot. Next, we examine the role of randomisation
(allowing occasional incorrect answers) in making apparently
intractable problems easier. We meet a surprising characterisation
of the class NP in terms of ``probabilistically checkable proofs,''
and make an equally surprising connection between this new view of
NP and non-approximability of combinatorial optimisation problems.
Finally, we investigate some really hard problems that are provably
intractable.</td>

<tr><td><h2>Summary of Intended Learning Outcomes</h2></td></tr>
<tr><td>1 - Students will be able to formulate models of sequential,
randomised and parallel compution, and be able to describe the
relationships between these models.
2 - They will be able to quantify the resources employed by these
models, such as time, space and circuit size/depth.
3 - Students will be able to analyse computational problems from a
complexity perspective, and so locate them within the complexity
landscape (a landscape which is much refined from that described in
Computability and Intractability).
4 - In particular, they will further develop their skill in
conducting a completeness proof, which is in a sense a practical
skill.
5 - Students will be able to apply mathematical skills and
knowledge from earlier years (e.g., from probability theory and
logic) to concrete problems in computational complexity.
6 - Students will study the topic in sufficient depth as to gain an
appreciation of some of the challenging issues in computer science
today (e.g., P =? NP).</td></tr>
