to give students practical experience of (a) building a large scale
system (b) working as members of a team. The project involves
applying and combining material from several courses to complete a
complex design and implementation task. At the end of course each
group demonstrates its implemented system and gives a formal
presentation to an audience of the students, supervisors, and
visitors from industry.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Successful completion of Year 2 of an Informatics

Assessment
The assessment is based on the achievements of the project work
described above and its documentation, typically a design
specification, a feasibility report, a management report and an
implementation report. Each group member also submits an individual
document describing his/her contribution to the project.For each
student, 50% of the marks will be based on the achievements of the
group and %50 on his or her individual report. Students who make no
contribution to the work of the group will receive a mark of
0%.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>During this project students work in groups of
about ten on the design and implementation of a complete system to
solve some practical and useful problem. All groups perform the
same task. This primarily involves software implementation but may
potentially also involve hardware design and construction where
this is relevant. Recent examples of projects include: an automated
on-line supermarket; building webcam-based home and commercial
security systems; constructing Mars and Lunar rovers controlled
from an Earth-based web browser interface, etc.

Each group is provided with the same facilities. These include one
or more PCs dedicated to them and other equipment depending on the
particular project, for instance a webcam, a Lego robot
construction kit, hardware prototyping kit, diagnostic equipment
etc. They also have a small amount of money to spend in any way
they choose on any extra items they feel might enhance their
particular design. Project management software is also available to
them.

A staff member is assigned to each group as a supervisor. The
supervisor's task is to advise and provide feedback on the progress
of the group during the project but not to provide technical
support. Consultants from amongst the academic and support staff
are made available to advise on aspects of the task such as
management, specific pieces of software and hardware etc. Groups
meet with their supervisors at least once a week. They also meet
amongst themselves more frequently to plan and coordinate their
activities.

Towards the end of the semester, a day is set aside for groups to
demonstrate their implemented system and to give a formal
presentation of it to an audience of the students, supervisors, and
visitors from industry.
