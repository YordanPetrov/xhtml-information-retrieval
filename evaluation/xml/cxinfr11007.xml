modern techniques for analyzing, interpreting, visualizing and
exploiting the data that is captured in scientific and commercial
environments. The course will develop the ideas taught in the
modules Learning from Data 1 and Probabilistic Modelling and
Reasoning and discuss the issues in applying them to real-world
data sets, as well as teaching about other techniques and
data-visualization methods. The course will also feature case-study
presentations and each student will undertake a mini-project on a
real-world dataset.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Probabilistic

Assessment
Two items, (1) the presentation of research paper on data mining to
the class and (2) a mini-project on one dataset chosen from a list
of datasets selected by the instructor.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>The course will consist of two parts, the first
part being a series of lectures on what is outlined below. It is
anticipated that there will also be one or two guest lectures from
data mining practitioners.

The second part will consist of student presentations of papers
relating to relevant topics. Students will also carry out a
practical mini-project on a real-world dataset. For both paper
presentations and mini-projects, lists of suggestions will be
available, but students may also propose their own, subject to
approval from the instructor.

* Introduction, overview
* Data preprocessing and cleaning, dealing with missing data
* Data visualization, exploratory data analysis
* Data mining techniques, e.g. Association rules (Apriori
algorithm),
* Predictive modelling techniques (e.g. SVMs)
* Performance evaluation (e.g. ROC curves)
* Issues relating to large data sets
* Application areas, e.g. text mining, collaborative filtering,
retrieval-by-content, web mining, bioinformatics data, astronomy
data
