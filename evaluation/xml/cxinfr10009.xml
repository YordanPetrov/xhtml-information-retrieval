such as ellipsoids for modelling. Consider the following problem:
we are given an ellipsoid, a point from which to view it, and a
plane on which the viewed image is to appear. The problem is to
find the contour of the image as an equation (a numerical solution
is not good enough for many applications). The problem does not
involve particularly difficult mathematics, but a solution by hand
is very difficult in general. This is an example of a problem which
can be solved fairly easily with a computer algebra system. These
systems have a very wide range of applications and are useful both
for routine work and research. From a computer science point of
view they also give rise to interesting problems in implementation
and the design of algorithms. The considerations here are not only
theoretical but also pragmatic: for example there is an algorithm
for polynomial factorization which runs in polynomial time; however
systems do not use this since other (potentially exponential time)
methods work faster in practice. The design of efficient algorithms
in this area involves various novel techniques. The material of the
course will be related whenever possible to the computer algebra
system Maple, leading to a working knowledge of the system.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>It is RECOMMENDED that students have passed
