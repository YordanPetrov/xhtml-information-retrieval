relating to representation, reasoning and planning for solving real
world inference. The course illustrates the importance of (i) using
a smart representation of knowledge such that it is conducive to
efficient reasoning, and (ii) the need for exploiting task
constraints for intelligent search and planning. The notion of
representing action, space and time is formalized in the context of
agents capable of sensing the environment and taking actions that
affect the current state. There is also a strong emphasis on the
ability to deal with uncertain data in real world scenarios and
hence, the planning and reasoning methods are extended to include
inference in probabilistic domains.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 1 -
