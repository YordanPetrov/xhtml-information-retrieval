introductory computer vision material taught in Introduction to
Vision and Robotics. The main aim is to give students an
understanding of main concepts in visual processing by constructing
several vision systems during the course of the lecture series and
practicals.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Introduction to

Assessment
There are 2 lab-based practicals at 10% each, plus a 3rd assignment
for 10% more. The lab exercise is done in teams of 2. These
exercises usually involve: 1) basic image processing and 2) 3D
scene or video analysis. Any programming language can be used, but
Matlab is the language used in the lecture materials. The 3rd
assignment will be to create a web page summarising a topic in
CVonline for which no material exists at present. There will be a
small set of alternative topics suitable for level 10 students
available for the web page construction.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>In the course of constructing six vision systems,
students will learn about: image noise reduction, region growing,
boundary segmentation, Canny edge detector, Hough transform,
RANSAC, 2D and 3D coordinate systems, interpretation tree matching,
rigid 2D object modeling, 2D position estimation, point
distribution models, 3D range sensors, range data segmentation, 3D
position estimation, stereo sensors, motion tracking, snakes and
various approaches to object recognition.

The activities of the module are designed to further develop
intellectual skills in the areas of: laboratory, writing (lab
reports and short essays), teamwork, critical analysis, programming
and laboratory skills.</syllabus><transferable_skills>Not entered</transferable_skills><reading_list>* R. Jain, R. Kasturi, B. G. Schunck, Machine
