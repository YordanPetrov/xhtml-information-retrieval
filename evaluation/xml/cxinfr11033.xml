practice of automatic speech recognition (ASR), with a focus on the
statistical approaches that comprise the state of the art. The
course introduces the overall framework for speech recognition,
including speech signal analysis, acoustic modelling using hidden
Markov models, language modelling and recognition search. Advanced
topics covered will include speaker adaptation, robust speech
recognition and speaker identification. The practical side of the
course will involve the development of a speech recognition system
using a speech recognition software toolkit.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>It is RECOMMENDED that students have passed

probabilistic terms;
4 - relate individual terms in the mathematical framework for
speech recognition to particular modules of the system;
