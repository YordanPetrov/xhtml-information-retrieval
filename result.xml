  <c_description>The goal of this strand is to
          introduce the notions of computation and specification using
          finite-state systems and propositional logic. Finite state machines
          provide a simple model of computation that is widely used, has an
          interesting meta-theory and has immediate application in a range of
          situations. They are used as basic computational models across the
          whole of Informatics and at the same time are used successfully in
          many widely used applications and components. Propositional logic,
          similarly is the first step in understanding logic which is an
          essential element of the specification of Informatics systems and
          their properties.</c_description>
