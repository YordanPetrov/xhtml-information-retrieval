researchers have been interested in making computers learn, rather
than simply programming them to do tasks. This is the field of
machine learning. The main area that will be discussed is
supervised learning, which is concerned with learning to predict an
output, given inputs. A second area of study is unsupervised
learning, where we wish to discover the structure in a set of
patterns; there is no output "teacher signal".

The primary aim of the course is to provide the student with a set
of practical tools that can be applied to solve real-world problems
in machine learning, coupled with an appropriate, principled
approach to formulating a solution.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>This course has the following mathematics
prerequisites:

1 - Probability theory: Discrete and continuous univariate random
variables. Expectation, variance. Univariate Gaussian distribution.
Joint and conditional distributions. (At the level taught in MfI
1&amp;4)

2 - Linear algebra: Vectors and matrices: definitions, addition.
Matrix multiplication, matrix inversion. Eigenvectors, determinants
quadratic forms. (At the level taught in MfI 2&amp;3).

3 - Calculus: Functions of several variables. Partial
differentiation. Multivariate maxima and minima. (At the level
taught in MfI 1&amp;2)

4 - Special functions: Log, exp are fundamental.(At the level
taught in MfI 1)

5 - Geometry: Basics of lines, planes and hyperplanes. Coordinate
geometry of circle, sphere, ellipse, ellipsoid and n-dimensional
generalizations. (At level taught in MfI 1&amp;4)

6 - Entropy: (as covered in MfI 1) is useful, but will be covered
in the lectures.</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>Yes</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester1, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  Yes</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday>14:00 - 14:50</Monday><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday>14:00 - 14:50</Thursday><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>First Class</Location><Activity>Week 1, Monday, 14:10 - 15:00,

and the main sub-areas of the field.
2 - Describe the various techniques covered in the syllabus and
where they fit within the structure of the discipline.
3 - Students should be able to critically compare, contrast and
evaluate the different ML techniques in terms of their
applicability to different Machine Learning problems.
4 - Given a data set and problem students should be able to use
appropriate software to apply these techniques to the data set to
solve the problem.
5 - Given appropriate data students should be able to use a
systematic approach to conducting experimental investigations and
assessing scientific hypotheses.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 75

Assessment
There would be one assignment, where a number machine learning
methods would be applied to a dataset. There could be more than one
dataset available to cater for different tastes.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>Introduction to Machine Learning and its Goals.
