techniques to the problems of making devices capable of interacting
with the physical world. This includes moving around in the world
(mobile robotics), moving things in the world (manipulation
robotics), acquiring information by direct sensing of the world
(e.g. machine vision) and, importantly, closing the loop by using
sensing to control movement. Applying AI in this context poses
certain problems, and sets certain limitations, which have
important effects on the general software and hardware
architectures. For example, a robot with legs must be able to
correct detected imbalances before it falls over, and a robot which
has to look left and right before crossing the road must be able to
identify approaching hazards before it gets run over. These
constraints become much more serious if the robot is required to
carry both its own power supply and its own brain along with it.
This module introduces the basic concepts and methods in these
areas, and serves as an introduction to the more advanced robotics
and vision modules.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Robotics: Science and

Single or Combined Degree, or equivalent by permission of the
School. This course assumes experience of AI knowledge and
representation issues (equivalent to first and second year courses
in Informatics); enough school algebra and geometry to understand
the optics of image formation with lenses; enough school physics to
understand Newton's Laws of Motion; the general mechanical
intuitions required in such tasks as bicycle maintenance; enough
electrical knowledge to understand how electric batteries make
electric motors work. You are expected to be familiar with these
mathematical methods: Bayes rule, Multivariate Gaussian
Distribution,
Covariance matrices, Convolution, the Jacobean (relating
derivatives of a vector valued function to its vector valued
inputs).</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>Yes</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester2, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday>11:10 - 12:00</Monday><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday>11:10 - 12:00</Thursday><Friday/></time></activity><first_class>Week 1, Monday, 11:10 - 12:00,

facts, concepts and principles in robotics and computer vision,
demonstrated through written answers in examination
conditions.
2 - Students will be able to describe and evaluate the strengths
and weaknesses of some specific sensor and motor hardware; and some
specific software methods for sensory processing and motor control,
demonstrated through written answers in examination
conditions.
3 - Students will be able to employ hardware (e.g. cameras, robots)
and software (e.g. Matlab,robot simulator) tools to solve a
practical problem of sensory-motor control, and will show a working
system in a practical class.
4 - Students will, in writing a joint report, identify problem
criteria and context, discuss design and development, test, analyse
and evaluate the behaviour of the sensory-motor control system they
have developed.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 75

following:

* Applications of robotics and vision; the nature of the problems
to be solved; historical overview and current state of the
art.
* Robot actuators and sensors. Parallels to biological
systems.
* Robot control: Open-loop, feed-forward and feedback; PID
(proportional integral differential) control.
* Image formation, transduction and simple processing;
thresholding, filtering and classification methods for extracting
object information from an image.
* Active vision and attention.
* Sensors for self monitoring.
* General approaches and architectures. Classical vs.
behaviour-based robotics. Wider issues and implications of robot
research.

The course also involves hands-on practicals in which vision and
robot systems will be programmed.
