<td width="30%">Course description</td>
<td width="70%">This course is intended as a
specialized course on models and techniques for decision making in
autonomous agents, such as intelligent robots, that must function
in rich interactive settings involving environments with other
agents and people.
This course will cover decision theoretic algorithms, interactive
decision making including game theoretic techniques, learning in
games and social settings, as well as selected topics involving
decentralized systems. We will also look at aspects of human
decision making, both to ask what people actually do and to
consider what agents must do in light of this.
Issues of intelligent and fluid interaction by autonomous
robots/agents, operating in environments including other strategic
agents (either other autonomous agents or people), are becoming
increasingly more important - with the advent of systems that
routinely embody rich and sophisticated multi-modal interfaces,
making it possible for us to now consider issues of interactive
behaviour. At the same time but from a seemingly opposite
perspective, 'market design' approaches are becoming increasingly
more
suitable to the needs of collections of individually simple robots
and agents (and people) that must work together on sophisticated
large scale tasks.
The content of this course has connections to other courses within
our existing curriculum, such as Reinforcement Learning and
Algorithmic Game Theory. A noteworthy difference is that this
course will focus more heavily on issues of modelling - how tasks
associated with robotics and autonomous agents could/should be
expressed and analysed using the formal language of these models,
and also have more coverage of learning and potential connections
to mechanisms of (boundedly rational) human decision making. This
course will be self contained, discussing salient algorithmic
techniques associated with some of the major models being
considered. However, we expect this knowledge to be complemented by
the more detailed discussion of techniques in the RL and AGTA
courses. Similarly, students will benefit from prior exposure to
robotics at the level of the R:SS course (or some equivalent
exposure to autonomous agent design), which provides the
perspective necessary to fully appreciate the concerns of this
course.</td>

<tr><td>- formulate practical problems involving interaction (e.g.,
human-robot interaction) in the language of decision and game
theory
- analyze and evaluate conceptual problems with decision models
involving multiple agents
- analyze and implement selected learning algorithms that consider
incomplete information and partial observability
- demonstrate understanding of key issues related to decision
making in humans; identify when, why and how standard models fail
to capture real behaviour</td></tr>

<td width="70%">The DMR course will cover the following major
themes:

Introduction
- Problems involving interaction: Strategically rich human-robot
interaction; Teams of autonomous agents; Market design
- Survey of existing models of interaction: from psychology,
cognitive science and machine learning

Decision Theory:
- The utility maximization framework of decision theory
- Bandit problems, online learning and related models (e.g.,
matching problems)
- Markov Decision Processes and variants

Interactive Decision Making:
- Tools and techniques of game theoretic models
- Game theoretic models with incomplete information; models such as
Interactive POMDP
- Repeated interaction
- Models of bargaining and negotiation (including the incomplete
information case)
- Strategic learning in games

Mechanism Design and Related Topics in Decentralized Systems:
- Introduction to mechanism design and social choice
- Learning and mechanism design
- Graphical games, coordination games and social learning
models
- Special topics: models of asymmetric information and
privacy

Human Decision Making and Behavioural Issues:
- Behavioural aspects of human decision making - how real people
think about risk, games, etc.
- Reconciling behavioural findings with formal models</td>
