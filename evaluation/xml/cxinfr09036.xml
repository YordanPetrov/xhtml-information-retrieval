area within Artificial Intelligence in the last two decades,
exploring systems in which it is assumed that the computational
components are autonomous, and interact with each other in a common
environment. The aim of this course is to provide a comprehensive
introduction to agents and multiagent systems. It covers a broad
range of topics including agent architectures, agent interaction
and communication, and game-theoretic methods and models of
distributed rational decision making. It lays the foundations for
advanced courses such as Multi-Agent Semantic Web Systems and
Algorithmic Game Theory and its Applications.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 2D -

agents and interaction mechanisms for cooperative and competitive
settings.
- Use abstract formal models of agents and agent interactions to
analyse the properties of concrete designs.
- Explain the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of agents and
multiagent systems, with an emphasis on knowledge-based and
game-theoretic techniques.
- Be able to model, analyse and critically evaluate distributed
systems using agent-based abstractions and related concepts.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination: 100%
