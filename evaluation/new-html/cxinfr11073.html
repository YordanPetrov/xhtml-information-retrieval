<td width="30%">Course description</td>
<td width="70%">Both the study of Artificial
Intelligence - understanding how to build learning machines - and
the business of developing tools to analyse the numerous increasing
data sources involves developing a systematic understanding of how
we can learn from data. A principled approach to this problem is
critical given the wide differences in the places these methods
need to be used.

This course is a foundational course for anyone pursuing machine
learning, or interested in the intelligent utilisation of machine
learning methods. The primary aim of the course is enable the
student to think coherently and confidently about machine learning
problems, and present the student with a set of practical tools
that can be applied to solve real-world problems in machine
learning, coupled with an appropriate, principled approach to
formulating a solution.

This course avoids the potential pitfalls of simply presenting a
set of machine learning tools as if they were an end in themselves,
but follows the basic principles of machine learning methods in
showing how the different tools are developed, how they are
related, how they should be deployed, and how they are used in
practice. The course presents a number of methods in machine
learning that are increasingly used, including Bayesian methods,
and Gaussian processes.

This course is identical to the level 10 version except for an
additional learning outcome, and a consequential difference in
assessment.</td>

reasonable knowledge of computational, logical, geometric and
set-theoretic concepts is assumed. Working knowledge of vectors and
matrices is also necessary. A basic grasp of probability and
partial differentiation, is strongly recommended.</td>

<tr><td><h2>Summary of Intended Learning Outcomes</h2></td></tr>
<tr><td>1 - Way of thinking - the course introduces an approach to
thinking about machine learning problems. Learning Outcome: The
students will be able to describe why a particular model is
appropriate in a given situations, formulate the model and use it
appropriately.
2 - A strong foundation - the course will provide students with the
core techniques and methods needed to use machine learning in any
area. Learning Outcome: The student will be able to analytically
demonstrate how different models and different algorithms are
related to one another.
3 - Practical capability - the course will provide students with
the theoretical background needed to assess good practice, along
with the practical experience. Learning Outcome: Students will be
able to implement a set of practical methods, given example
algorithms in MATLAB, and be able to program solutions to some
given real world machine learning problems, using the toolbox of
practical methods presented in the lectures.
4 - Thoroughness - students will leave the course with a deep
understanding of machine learning and its aims and limitations.
Learning Outcome: Given a particular situation, students will be
able be able to justify why a given model is appropriate for the
situation or why it is not appropriate. Students will be able to
developing an appropriate algorithm from a given model, and
demonstrate the use of that method.
5 - Coherence - the course provide a unifying coherent view on
machine learning. Learning Outcome: students will be able to design
and compare machine learning methods, and discuss how different
methods relate to one another and will be able to develop new and
appropriate machine learning methods appropriate for particular
problems.
6 - Breadth of Thinking - Learning outcome: Given a complex
problem, students will be able to: (a) identify sub-problems that
are amenable to solution using Machine Learning techniques, (b)
provide solutions to those sub-problems, and evaluation of the
solutions.</td></tr>

Assessment
There will be two assignments for the course, one for each half of
the course contents. This will involve practical hands on data
analysis as well as questions about the ideas on the course. The
level 11 course will test for the additional learning
outcome.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</td></tr>
