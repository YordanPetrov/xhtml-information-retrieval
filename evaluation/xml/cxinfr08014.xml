practical introduction to object oriented programming, exemplified
by Java. As well as providing a grounding in the use of Java, the
course will cover general principles of programming in imperative
and object oriented frameworks. After completing the course
successfully, students will be able to develop programs that
support experimentation, simulation and exploration in other parts
of the Informatics curriculum (e.g. the capacity to implement, test
and observe a particular algorithm).</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 1 -

used in imperative and object-oriented programming.
2 - Given a detailed design, develop a working program that
implements the design.
3 - Develop small programs, or components of larger ones, or modify
existing ones, to solve clearly defined programming problems.
4 - Given a clearly described component, develop a test set and
test code for a component. Use code review and debugging tools to
identify the location of a fault in an erroneous program.
5 - Run and analyse a given program; describe how well it works
compared to its specification, or identify ways in which it
fails.
6 - Apply basic tools to aid in developing programs (e.g. IDE,
version control).</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 95

Assessment
Formative assessment will be used to provide feedback and guidance
to students and will take the form of quizzes, exercise sheets,
practical exercises and coursework assignments, covering areas from
across the syllabus. A summatively assessed class test (worth 5% of
the final mark) will be held mid semester and will test students
basic programming competence.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>An introduction to the concepts of programming
