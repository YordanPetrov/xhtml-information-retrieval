principles, systems and algorithms behind Web-scale problem
solving. This touches upon the technologies and techniques used by
companies such as Google, FaceBook and Microsoft, using
warehouse-scale computing and massive datasets. The course will be
in three parts: the principles behind extreme computing (cloud
computing, scaling, performance, privacy etc), supporting
infrastructure (distributed file systems, replication, web services
etc) and algorithms (MapReduce, case studies from Natural Language
Processing, Database query evaluation, machine learning,
streaming).</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Background in programming.</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>No</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester1, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday>16:10 - 17:00</Monday><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday>16:10 - 17:00</Thursday><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>First Class</Location><Activity>Week 1, Monday, 16:10 - 17:00,

providing motivating examples of the scale of problems only extreme
computing can solve.

- Demonstrate knowledge of the infrastructure necessary for extreme
computing through enumerating different file system designs,
virtualisation techniques, and fault-tolerance paradigms. In
particular, the first essay coursework will present the students
with a large-scale computing problem and ask them to present a
design using the knowledge acquired from the first part of the
course (see also detailed syllabus).

- Demonstrate knowledge of cluster-based algorithms for natural
language processing, database query evaluation, machine learning,
and data stream processing through the use of the Map/Reduce
programming paradigm. Specifically, the second assessed piece of
coursework will test the students' ability to implement large-scale
data analytics using Map/Reduce.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Assessment Weightings (%)

main areas, with
each area not necessarily accounting for an equal portion of
the
syllabus. The three areas and the material covered in each area are
as
follows:

- Background: Motivation for new computing paradigms; introduction
and differences between cloud and cluster computing; scaling,
performance, privacy, economics, security, software as
service.

- Infrastructure: Distributed file systems; virtualisation;
replication; fault tolerance; concurrent programming; web
services.

- Algorithms: Hadoop (MapReduce); design and implementation of
MapReduce programs; dealing with massive amounts of data; case
studies using natural language processing, database query
evaluation and machine learning; data stream processing.</syllabus><transferable_skills>Not entered</transferable_skills><reading_list>Data Intensive Text Processing with MacReduce,
