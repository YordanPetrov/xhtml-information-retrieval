to the basic concepts and methodology needed to implement and
analyse computational models of cognition. It considers the
fundamental issues of using a computational approach to explore and
model cognition. In particular, we explore the way that
computational models relate to, are tested against, and illuminate
psychological theories and data.

The course will introduce both symbolic and subsymbolic modelling
methodologies, and provide practical experience with implementing
models. The symbolic part will focus on cognitive
architectures,
while the subsymbolic part will introduce probabilistic
models.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Successful completion of Year 2 of an Informatics

of cognitive modelling, by being able to design simple cognitive
models for sample problems.
- Demonstrate understanding of the relationship between
computational models and psychological theories, by being able to
critically assess the psychological adequacy of a given
model.
- Qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate computational models of
cognition using a range of techniques, when given a model and a set
of experimental data that it is supposed to account for.
- Demonstrate an awareness of the most important computational
approaches to cognitive modelling, by being able to use these
approaches to formalise theories that are couched in
potentially
vague and ambiguous terms (e.g., natural language).
- Use existing modelling tools (e.g., Cogent or Matlab) to design
and test computer implementations of cognitive models (both
existing models from the literature and simple models they have
designed themselves).</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70

Assessment:
The assignments will require students to develop or modify
cognitive models using the Cogent cognitive modelling package or
other software for probabilistic modelling. Students will also be
required to analyse the adequacy of their models with respect to
psychological data, and critically evaluate models and ideas
presented in course readings (e.g., Marr's three levels of
analysis).</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>- An introduction/review of the idea of
computational approaches to studying cognition; the mind as
information-processing system; Marr's levels of analysis
(computational, algorithmic, implementation).
- The general motivations underlying the computational modelling of
cognition, and different kinds of questions that can be answered
(e.g., why do cognitive processes behave as they do, or what
algorithms might be used to carry out this behaviour? What kinds of
information are used, or how is this information
processed/integrated over time?)
- Mechanistic/algorithmic approaches and issues addressed by these
approaches: parallel versus serial processing, flow of information,
timing effects.
- Rational/probabilistic approaches and issues addressed by these
approaches: adaptation to the environment, behaviour under
uncertainty, learning, timing effects.
- General issues: top-down versus bottom-up processing, online
processing, integration of multiple sources of information.
- Methodology and issues in the development and evaluation of
cognitive models: Which psychological data are relevant? What
predictions are made by a model? How could these be tested?
- Modelling techniques: in the assignments, students will
experiment with both symbolic (rulebased) and subsymbolic
(probabilistic) cognitive models.
- Example models: in a number of areas we will look at the theories
proposed and different ways of modelling them. Areas discussed will
include several of the following: language processing, reasoning,
memory, high-level vision, categorization. Specific models will be
introduced and analysed with regard to relevant psychological
data.</syllabus><transferable_skills>Not entered</transferable_skills><reading_list>Modelling High-Level Cognitive Processes, Richard
