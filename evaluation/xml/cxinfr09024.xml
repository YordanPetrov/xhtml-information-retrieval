in-depth coverage of software testing further to develop the
introductory material covered in Inf2C. The goal of the course is
to provide students with the skill to select and apply a testing
strategy and testing techniques that are appropriate to a
particular software system or component. In addition the student
will become a capable user of test tools; will be able to assess
the effectiveness of their testing activity; and will be able
provide evidence to justify their evaluation. The course will be
supported by two practical exercises involving the development of
appropriate tests and the application of a range of testing tools.
This course is based on the IEEE Software Engineering 2004 Software
Testing syllabus.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: ( Informatics 2C

Assessment
The coursework will comprise two, equally weighted, assessed
practicals the first will concentrate on unit and integration
testing the second on acceptance and performance testing. Both
practicals will involve working with a reasonably large sample of
code.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus># Testing techniques and principles: Defects vs.
