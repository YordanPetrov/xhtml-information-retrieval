level introduction to several core areas in robotics: kinematics,
dynamics and control; motion planning; state estimation,
localization and mapping; vision for robotics. Lectures on these
topics will be complemented by a large practical that exercises
knowledge of a cross section of these techniques in the
construction of an integrated robot in the lab, motivated by a task
such as robot navigation. Also, in addition to lectures on
algorithms and lab sessions, we expect that there will be several
lecture hours dedicated to discussion of implementation issues -
how to go from the equations to code.

The aim of the course is to present a unified view of the field,
culminating in a practical involving the development of an
integrated robotic system that actually embodies key elements of
the major algorithmic techniques.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Introduction to
