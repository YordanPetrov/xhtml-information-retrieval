Computer Communications and Networks, focusing on fundamental
concepts, principles and techniques. The course will introduce
basic networking concepts, including: protocol, network
architecture, reference models, layering, service, interface,
multiplexing, switching and standards. An overview of digital
communication from the perspective of computer networking will also
be provided. Topics covered in this course include: Internet
(TCP/IP) architecture and protocols, network applications,
congestion/flow/error control, routing and internetworking, data
link protocols, error detection and correction, channel allocation
and multiple access protocols, communication media and selected
topics in wireless and mobile networks. This course will also give
hands-on experience in network programming using the socket
API.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Successful completion of Year 2 of an Informatics
