unified view of programming language semantics and implementation,
based upon the linked notions of structured operational semantics
and abstract machines. Different styles of languages (such as
declarative and object oriented) will be treated.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Successful completion of Year 2 of an Informatics

implementation, and of type-checking.
2 - Formal approaches to problems, including mathematical modelling
via definitions and proofs by induction.
3 - Ability to read, write and exercise formal specifications of
programming languages.
4 - Ability to read and appreciate formal specifications of
programming and other formal langauges, and, perhaps, formal
specification more generally. Improved ability in discrete
mathematics.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 80

Assessment Information
Two written assignments each contribute 10% to the final course
grade, and are particularly directed at learning outcome 3. A
written examination contributes the remaining 80%.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>Dynamic Language Semantics: Semantic rules as an
inference system; treatment of variable assignment, iteration,
scope, function declaration and application, parameter passing,
records, recursion. Static Semantics: Semantic rules for type
checking as an inference system. Abstract Machines and
Implementation: The SMC machine for an imperative while language
and the Java Virtual Machine.
