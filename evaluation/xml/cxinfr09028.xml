linguistic and algorithmic foundations of natural language
processing. It builds on the material introduced in Informatics 2A
and aims to equip students for more advanced NLP courses in years 3
or 4. The course is strongly empirical, using corpus data to
illustrate both core linguistic concepts and algorithms, including
language modeling, part of speech tagging, syntactic processing,
the syntax-semantics interface, and aspects of semantic processing.
Linguistic and algorithmic content will be interleaved throughout
the course.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 2A -

to select a corpus and an annotation scheme for the problem and
justify the choice over other candidates.
2 - Students should also be able to identify suitable evaluation
measures for the problem and provide a written explanation of the
role of annotated corpora in natural language processing.
3 - Given one of the main linguistic issues relevant to NLP
(including the representation and induction of syntactic knowledge,
and the modelling of lexical and semantic information, and the
syntax-semantics interface), students should be able to construct
an example of the issue and provide an explanation of how their
example illustrates the issue in general.
4 - Given an example of one of the main linguistic issues
identified above, students should be able to classify it as
belonging to that issue and relate the example to the issue in
general.
5 - Given an NLP problem, students should be able to analyse,
assess and justify which algorithms are most appropriate for
solving the problem, based on an understanding of fundamental
algorithms such as Viterbi algorithm, inside-outside, chart-based
parsing and generation.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70

Assessment
Two assignments involving both programming and short essays.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>1. Creating annotated corpora:
* markup, annotation
* evaluation measures
* corpora and the web

2. Lexicon and lexical processing:
* language modeling
* Hidden Markov Models
* part of speech tagging (e.g., for a language other than English)
to illustrate HMMs
* Viterbi algorithm
* smoothing

3. Syntax and syntactic processing:
* revision of context-free grammars and chart parsing
* syntactic concepts: constituency, subcategorization, bounded and
unbounded dependencies, feature representations
* lexicalized grammar formalisms (e.g., TAG, CCG, dependency
grammar)
* treebanks: lexicalized grammars and corpus annotation

4. Semantics and semantic processing:
* compositionality
* argument structure
* word sense disambigution
* anaphora resolution
* treebanks: argument structure, WSD (e.g., Propbank, Semcor)
