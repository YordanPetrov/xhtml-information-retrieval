efficient, research in Bioinformatics is that scientists from
both
fields (biology and informatics) are involved, or consulted. Team
work can only be successful if all
parties have a basic ground knowledge of the respective other field
and, most importantly, that they can
communicate with each other.

The aims of the course are to help you overcome both of these
difficulties in your future careers. The course
will cover topics that include core biology concepts that relate to
bioinformatics, biological data and their
source and structure as well as common tools for their
analysis.

The course will also involve group-based practical work on using
and developing bioinformatics solutions.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>For Informatics PG and final year MInf students
only, or by special permission of the School. Parts of this course
assume a basic knowledge in biology beyond general high school
standards (i.e. is suitable for everyone with a University
education in a biology-related field).

Students with a higher education in a biology-related field can ask
to be exempted from the first half of the course (excluding
assessed coursework and exam).</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>Yes</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester1, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday>14:00 - 15:50</Friday></time></activity><first_class>Week 1, Friday, 14:00 - 15:50,

Assessment
Coursework is assessed though two reports on using/deploying the
students own bioinformatics services and the remainder through a
final examination.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>The course will cover the following:

Essential Biology
* DNA/proteins
* Evolution
* Chromosomes and Cells
* Molecular structures

Note that students with a higher education in biology can be
exempted from this part of the course

Modern Biology
* Computational assembly of genomic sequence (including a site
visit to see automated sequencing technology at work)
* Expression profiling (including a site visit to the Scottish
Centre for Genomics and Informatics Technology, GTI)
* Polymorphisms and Phylogenetics (e.g. RFLP)
* Structure Determination (Crystallography/NMR)
* Proteomics (various techniques)

There will be one written exercise (short essay) which will carry
20% of the course marks; the exam will carry 80%.
