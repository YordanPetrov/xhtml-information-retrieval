How the brain computes and processes information from the outside
world.

How the brain wires up and how it stores information.

We will study the brain at a fairly low level, so that we can make
contact with neurophysiological data. We will show the necessary
biological data and how it can be described in mathematical terms.
We will present modelling methods applicable to various levels of
organisation of the nervous system (e.g. single cells, networks of
cells). We discuss models of particular brain subsystems.

In the practical session we use Matlab and NEURON to simulate the
models (No familiarity with NEURON required, some self study of
Matlab is beneficial.)</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>For Informatics PG and final year MInf students

computation.
2 - Abstract neuroscience experimental data to a model and should
be able to critically evaluate these models.
3 - Understand the major limitations in verifying the model
experimentally.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 0
