methods and their application to computer science. The course
introduces basic models and techniques and applies these techniques
to the design of various randomized algorithms, data structures,
and distributed protocols. Special emphasis will be given on
applications of these ideas to other areas of computer science
(e.g. networking, machine learning, etc).</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>It is RECOMMENDED that students have passed
Algorithms and Data
Structures (INFR09006)</prerequisites><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Basic knowledge of (1) discrete probability and (2)
algorithms is required. In particular, the students should have a
good understanding of the following concepts:

(1) probability spaces and events, conditional probability and
independence, random variables, expectations and moments,
conditional expectation.

(2) asymptotic notation, basic sorting algorithms (Quick-sort,
Merge-sort), basic graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra).</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>No</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester2, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday>14:00 - 15:50</Tuesday><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><first_class>Week 1, Tuesday, 14:10 - 16:00,
