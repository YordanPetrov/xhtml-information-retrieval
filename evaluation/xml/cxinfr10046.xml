computer-aided modelling for performance evaluation of (stochastic)
dynamic systems. The emphasis is on stochastic modeling of computer
systems and communication networks; however other dynamic systems
such as manufacturing systems will also be considered. The central
concept of the course will be that a model, as well as being an
abstract representation of a system, is a tool which we can exploit
to derive information about the system. The more detail we invest
in the model, the more sophisticated the information we can extract
from it. As the course progresses the models will become
increasingly detailed; the corresponding solution techniques will
similarly become more complex, relying on increasing levels of
computer assistance and visualisation.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Performance Modelling

modelling and the trade-offs between timeliness and efficient use
of resources. They will be able to demonstrate this by an ability
to give an account of these ideas and explain why the trade-off
occurs.
2 - Students will know the operational laws and be able to apply
them to any system which satisfies the appropriate conditions to
derive further information about the system. Furthermore they will
be able to assess from a system description whether the conditions
are met.
3 - They will have the ability to design, construct and solve a
simple performance model based on a Markov process in various
high-level modelling formalisms as well as directly at the state
transition level. Moreover they will be able to give an account of
the underlying mathematics and the concepts of steady state and
transient analysis. The students should understand, and be able to
give an account of, the assumptions which must be made about a
system in order to model it as a Markov process.
4 - Students also develop judgement with respect to choosing an
appropriate modelling technique for a given scenario, so that when
given a description of a problem, and the resources and skills
available, they are able to recommend the best-suited modelling
formalism and solution technique.
5 - Students will learn to abstract from extraneous detail and
focus on the important aspects of a problem.
6 - Students will develop the ability to assimilate knowledge about
different formalisms and tools and put them to practical use.
7 - Students will develop skills in analysing and interpreting
presented data.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 75

Assessment
The coursework is comprised of two practical exercises which
exercise modelling skills in different formalisms. The second
modelling coursework uses the stochastic process algebra
PEPA.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>*Modelling and performance evaluation: models as
