concepts introduced in the Database Systems course, through adding
complexity and a more hands-on approach. In particular, we will
focus on the concepts of query optimisation and evaluation from an
implementation-oriented point of view. We will focus on the path a
database query follows: (i) declaratively specified in SQL, (ii)
translated in an algebraic representation, (ii) optimised through a
cost-based optimisation framework, (iv) tranaslated into an
evaluation plan, and, finally, (v) evaluated by the database
engine. Finally, the issues of transaction processing, concurrency
control and crash recovery will be discussed in depth.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Database Systems

layed out on disk for various file structures and how the said file
structures are used by a database system.
2 - Demonstrate knowledge of query evaluation by describing and
implementing various evaluation algorithms used by database
systems
3 - Demonstrate knowledge of cost-based query optimisation by
describing search space exploration and by extracting the cost for
arbitrary evaluation plans.
4 - Demonstrate knowledge of transaction processing and concurrency
control using lock tables and/or optimisic methods of concurrency
control.
5 - Demonstrate knowledge of crash recovery by describing the
methodologies and algorithms emplyoed by a database system in the
event of a crash.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70

Assessment
Two programming assignments. The assignments will account in total
for 30% of the final grade. Both assignments will be equally
weighted.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>This is a rough overview of what will ideally be
covered if time permits. If needed, the time spent on each part
will be adjusted as the course progresses.

* Relational Databases Overview: Relational Schema; Storage
Structures.

* Query Evaluation: SQL; Relational Algebra and Equivalence Rules;
