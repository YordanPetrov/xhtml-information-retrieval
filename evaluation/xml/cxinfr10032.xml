web, data in different formats is scattered across many sources.
Data sources may only provide partial access to data and the
structure of the data may differ drastically from the assumptions
used in conventional queries.

Querying such data requires data integration and exchange between
different sources. The notion of querying and the meaning of an
answer to a query are different from their classical counterparts:
since only a partial view of the data is available, answers to
queries are at best approximate. Furthermore, integrated data may
not be consistent with its specification, and hence techniques for
querying inconsistent data become more important.

This course presents the basics of data integration and exchange,
explains techniques for querying incomplete and inconsistent
information, for specifying correspondences between database
schemas and schema mappings, and for querying databases using
views. Both relational and XML data formats are considered.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Database Systems

analysing, integrating and querying data that may come from a
variety of sources.

1 - Given a description of a situation requiring data integration
students will be able to classify it as belonging to one of a
number of standard scenarios.
2 - Given a description of data integration and exchange scenario
and a commercial database management solution to the problem
students will be able to predict erroneous or counterintuitive
answers that will arise from the solution.
3 - Given a description of a data integration and exchange scenario
where access to data is restricted, students will be able to design
a scheme to provide approximate results to queries taking account
of restricted access.
4 - Given a database query and a data integration and exchange
scenario, students will know how to rewrite the query to take
account of the scenario, providing approximate solutions where
these are necessary.
5 - Given two database schemas students will be able to specify
mappings between schemas and how to compose such mappings.
6 - Given a collection of databases, their schemas and mappings
between schemas students will be able to describe how data is
exchanged based on the schema mappings.
7 - Given a collection of databases, their schemas and schema
mappings, students will be able to identify instances of
inconsistent data.
8 - Given a collection of databases with inconsistent data, their
schemas and schema mappings, students will be able to describe the
results of queries on inconsistent databases.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70
