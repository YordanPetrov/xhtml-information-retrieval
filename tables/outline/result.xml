<c_description>This course is designed as a first
          introduction into cognitive science. It will provide a broad
          overview of the subject suitable for all interested students,
          including students on the Cognitive Science degrees and external
          students.
          
          The aim of the course is to present a unified view of the field,
          based on a computational approach to analyzing cognition. The
          material is presented grouped by cognitive function, rather than by
          subdiscipline.
          
          The course covers vision and attention, memory, motor control and
          action, reasoning and problem solving, and language. All topics
          will be presented from a computational point of view, and this
          perspective will be reinforced by a lab sessions in which students
          use implementations of cognitive models. The course will also
          provide a basic grounding in cognitive science methodology,
          focusing computational modeling, experimental design, and
          statistics. Both symbolic and subsymbolic modeling approaches will
          be covered.</c_description>
