to the introductory course on robotics (R:SS) and will gear
students towards advanced topics in robot control and planning from
a machine learning perspective.
Control of complex, compliant, multi degree of freedom (DOF)
sensorimotor systems like humanoid robots or autonomous vehicles
have been pushing the limits of traditional planning and control
methods.
This course aims at introducing a machine learning approach to the
challenges and will take the students through various aspects
involved in motor planning, control, estimation, prediction and
learning with an emphasis on the computational perspective. We will
learn about statistical machine learning tools and methodologies
particularly geared towards problems of real-time, online learning
for robot control.
Issues and possible approaches for learning in high dimensions,
planning under uncertainty and redundancy, sensorimotor
transformations and stochastic optimal control will be discussed.
This will be put in context through exposure to topics in human
motor control, experimental paradigms and the use of computational
methods in understanding biological sensorimotor mechanisms.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>None</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>Yes</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester2, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday>10:00 - 10:50</Monday><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday>10:00 - 10:50</Thursday><Friday/></time></activity><first_class>Week 1, Monday, 10:00 - 10:50,
