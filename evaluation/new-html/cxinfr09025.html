<td width="70%">Computer Security is concerned with
the protection of computer systems and their data from threats
which may compromise integrity, availability, or confidentiality;
the focus is on threats of a malicious nature rather than
accidental. This course aims to give a broad understanding of
computer security. Topics include security risks, attacks,
prevention and defence methods; techniques for writing secure
programs; an overview of the foundations for cryptography, security
protocols and access control models.</td>

<tr><td><h2>Summary of Intended Learning Outcomes</h2></td></tr>
<tr><td>1 - recognise the security threats against computer systems,
and have at least a high-level idea of the ways to address
them;
2 - apply techniques and design principles underlying security
solutions, including aspects of cryptography and security
protocols;
3 - be able to analyse simple security protocols using a formal
method;
4 - be able to use the World Wide Web to research the latest
security alerts and information.</td></tr>

Assessment Information
Two exercises. One involving programming such as implementing
application-level security features using Java's security APIs or
finding and fixing security flaws in a web application written in a
scripting language such as Python. The other exercise will be
written, requiring solving exercises in cryptography, protocols and
network security.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</td></tr>

<td width="30%">Syllabus</td>
<td width="70%">* Introduction and background. Risks and attacks:
to privacy (theft, surveillance); integrity (fraud); availability
(vandalism, denial of service). Additional security properties:
authentication, accountability.
* Cryptography: basic functional foundations. Symmetric algorithms,
for example: DES, Rijndael, RC4
* Public key cryptography. Algorithms including RSA, ElGamal. Hash
functions, including SHA-1. Digital signatures and
certificates.
* Authentication: mechanisms and attacks. Protocols for
authentication and key exchange, including Needham-Schroeder,
Otway-Rees, Kerberos, Diffie-Hellman.
* Formal approaches, including Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic for
authentication and its application to security protocol
analysis.
* Malicious code and network defences: Trojan horses, viruses and
worms, attacks on faulty code. Auditing, intrusion detection,
alarms and honey pots.
* Security engineering: security policy models, multi-level
systems. Secure kernels and trusted computing bases. Anatomy of
attacks, risk assessment, attack trees.
* Present internet technologies, for example: PGP, SSL, SSH, SMIME,
DNSSEC, IPsec, firewalls and VPNs. The Java Security Model and
security programming in Java.
* Copyright protection. Secure hardware and tamper resistance.
Steganography and covert communication. Anonymity.
* Security futures, real-world issues. Topics chosen from: web
security, e-commerce and e-cash; legalities; export control, key
escrow; information warfare and cyber terrorism; human factors.
Recent research areas.
