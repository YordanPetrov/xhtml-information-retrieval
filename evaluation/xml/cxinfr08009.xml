numerical data structures and algorithms for manipulating them.
Introductory numerical and symbolic learning methods provide a
context for the algorithms and data structures. To make the
presented ideas concrete, the module will extend the student's
skills in Java and Matlab. Examples will be taken from all areas of
Informatics.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 1 -
