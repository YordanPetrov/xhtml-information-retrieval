low-level format for data/document exchange, we shall need
techniques for storing and querying large quantities of the stuff.
Moreover it would be good if the query languages and the storage
techniques could be matched and efficiently implemented as they are
for relational databases.

This course is about research and development into storage
techniques and query languages for XML and, more generally,
semistructured data. It will cover the basics of types, APIs and
standard query languages as well as the relevant research and
prototypes.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Computability and

development issues for storing and querying XML data via
traditional database systems, and for publishing and integrating
data from traditional databases in XML. Many of the topics covered
are, or will be, in demand. The purpose is to prepare students for
both graduate study and job market.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 0

* XML basics: XML standard, DTD, XML Schema, query languages
(XPath, XQL, XSLT), and integrity constraints for XML.
* XML shredding: storing XML in relations, optimization and
normalization via constraint propagation.
* XML publishing: XML views of relational data, schema-directed
publishing.

XPath to SQL.
* Managing XML data stored in relations: incremental XML view
maintenance, XML view updates, XML updates.
* XML security: XML views for enforcing access control, automated
derivation of security views, and query rewriting.
