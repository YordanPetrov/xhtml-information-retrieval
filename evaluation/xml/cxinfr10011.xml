Assessment
One submission is required. This will be an in-depth technical
report on a topic of protocols and software that enables
convergence in all-IP networks in the telecommunications
industry.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>* Introduction: overview of current network
