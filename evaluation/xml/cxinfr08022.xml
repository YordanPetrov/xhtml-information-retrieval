basic skills required to develop computer programs using modern
computer systems, assuming little or no previous experience. It
also introduces fundamental concepts of program construction in a
suitable high-level programming language. The course has a
significant practical component requiring students to construct
small programs.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Informatics 1 -

programming language.

- They should have developed the problem-solving and technical
skills to analyse small-scale computational problems, and to
subsequently design, encode and debug C programs to solve such
problems.

- They will understand some of the basic principles underlying the
discipline of computer science, and gain some appreciation of
different styles of programming to the imperative style explored in
this course.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 90%
Coursework 10%

Formative assessment will be used to provide feedback and guidance
to students and will take the form of exercise sheets, practical
programming exercises and coursework assignments, covering areas
from across the syllabus. The goal will be to lead the students to
become independent programmers.

One of the coursework assignments will be for summative assessment:
this will be due mid-semester and will be worth 10% of the final
mark.

The exam will be a computer-based 3-hour exam.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>Introduction:
