often need to deal with uncertainty. For example, short segments of
a speech signal are ambiguous, and we need to take into account
context in order to make sense of an utterance. Probability theory
provides a rigorous method for representing and reasoning with
uncertain knowledge. The course covers two main areas (i) the
process of inference in probabilistic reasoning systems and (ii)
learning probabilistic models from data. Its aim is to provide a
firm grounding in probabilistic modelling and reasoning, and to
give a basis which will allow students to go on to develop their
interests in more specific areas, such as data-intensive
linguistics, automatic speech recognition, probabilistic expert
systems, statistical theories of vision etc.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>This course has the following mathematics
