<td width="30%">Course description</td>
<td width="70%">The study of Informatics generally
involves the formation of hypotheses and theories which can then be
tested through the creation of computer models. In order to create
these models, students need to be able to write their own computer
programs as well as use pre-existing special purpose systems and
tools. This module is intended to provide students who do not
already have significant computing experience, with the ability and
confidence to use Java as their programming tool for their summer
project work.

The course material follows the BlueJ book, supported by a series
of online, recorded lectures which allow students to work at their
own time and pace. Practical work is supported by timetabled
laboratory sessions, and the use of online tools for demonstrator
and peer support outside of the scheduled times.</td>

<tr><td><h2>Summary of Intended Learning Outcomes</h2></td></tr>
<tr><td>1 - Students will be able to state, in writing and verbally,
basic principles of object-oriented software design.
2 - Given an object oriented design as a diagram or textual
description, students will be able to evaluate the quality of that
design and discuss its strengths and weaknesses with respect to its
stated purpose.
3 - Students will be able to design an object oriented software
solution to a problem using diagrammatic and textual
representations.
4 - Students will be able to implement an object oriented design in
the Java language.
5 - Students will be able to relate the syntax of the Java language
to its semantics, and analyse the result of executing fragments of
Java syntax.
6 - Given a Java program, students will be able to explain, in
writing and verbally, what would happen when that program is
executed, and identify bugs which would prevent it executing as
described in the program documentation.
7 - Given a Java program and a debugging tool, students will be
able to identify and correct bugs which prevent the program from
functioning as intended.
8 - Students will be to write documentation in Javadoc style to
explain the design and implementation of their own code, or example
code which is supplied to them.
9 - Students will be able to use an appropriate software
development environment, such as BlueJ, Eclipse or NetBeans.
10 - Students will be able to integrate library code with their own
programs using appropriate software tools.
11 - Students will be able to use online technical documentation to
solve implementation problems as they arise during software
development.
12 - Students will be able to describe stages in the software
development process and the identify software tools which are used
to support these stages.</td></tr>

Assessment
Assessment is through two major practical programming exercises,
and an online, multiple-choice exam. Students will carry out some
of the work on the programming exercises during the assigned
laboratory sessions.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</td></tr>
