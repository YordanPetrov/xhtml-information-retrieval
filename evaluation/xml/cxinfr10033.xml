computers translating human languages (for example, from Arabic to
English). The field is now sufficiently mature that Google use it
to allow millions of people to translate Web Documents each day.
This course deals with all aspects of designing, building and
evaluating a range of state-of-the-art translation systems. The
systems covered are largely statistical and include: word-based,
phrase-based, syntax-based and discriminative models. As well as
exploring these systems, the course will cover practical aspects
such as using very large training sets, evaluation and the open
problem of whether linguistics can be useful for translation.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Foundations of

in the system.
2 - Design and justify an approach to the evaluation of the system
using state of the art tools and metrics
3 - Analyse the data collected by such an evaluation.
4 - Where the system is designed to deal with large volumes of data
the student should also be able to describe how the system handles
large data volumes and critically compare the system?s solution
with other common solutions to the problem.
5 - Identify where linguistics knowledge is relevant in the design
of the system and what influence of linguistic knowledge has on the
translation quality and performance of the system.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70

Assessment
A single piece of coursework dealing with some practical aspect of
translation. This will involve analysis of particular problems (for
example, reordering or word selection), as well as actual problem
solving. Typically, the problems set will not be
research-level.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>History of MT
