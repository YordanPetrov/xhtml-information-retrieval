categorised as a collection or network of loosely coupled,
autonomous computers that can communicate with each other and
execute logically separate computations, though these may be
related to concurrent computations on other nodes.

* The nodes are relatively loosely coupled.
* Each node is a self-contained autonomous computer with its own
peripherals.
* The system can survive various categories of node and network
failures.
* The nodes may execute logically separate computations, though
these may be related to concurrent computations on other
nodes.
* The system is asynchronous.

Distributed systems have become pervasive---many applications now
require the cooperation of two or more computers--yet the design
and implementation of such systems remain challenging and complex
tasks. Difficulties arise from the concurrency of components, the
lack of a global clock and the possibility of independent failure
of components. Moreover designs must aim to provide
inter-operability, transparency and autonomy.

The emphasis of this module is on gaining understanding of the
principles and concepts that are used to design distributed systems
and experience of software platforms which underpin their
development. Throughout the course examples written in Java will be
used.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Distributed Systems

system and be able to demonstrate this by explaining them;
2 - be able to give an account of the trade-offs which must be made
when designing a distributed system, and make such trade-offs in
their own designs;
3 - have developed practical skills of implementation of
distributed algorithms in software so that they will be able to
take an algorithm description and realise it in software;
4 - have gained experience in programming within a distributed
object system so that they can tackle a client, server or servant
implementation based on a interface description, and be able to
write interface descriptions in order to specify the objects of a
distributed object system;
5 - be able to give an account of the theoretical models used to
design distributed systems and to manipulate those models to reason
about such systems.
6 - The course presents a large amount of material, some of it in
case study form, so the students additionally develop skills of
assimilation.
7 - This course will teach students the principles of distributed
systems, in particular those aspects which make such systems
difficult to design and develop.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 75
