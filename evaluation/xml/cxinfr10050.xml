students to a variety of cognitive models and to discuss competing
models for similar problems, i.e. to explore a small number of
cognitive domains in depth rather than to aim for broad coverage,
as in CCS. The course will focus especially on how to evaluate and
compare models against each other and experimental data. Students
will be expected to present and critique classic and recent
research articles from the cognitive modelling literature, chosen
from a list provided by the instructor.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Topics in Cognitive

cognitive modelling by summarizing their central ideas and/or
results.
- Demonstrate understanding of the relationship between
computational models and psychological theories, by being able to
critically assess the psychological adequacy of a given
model.
- Compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of different
models of the same behaviour.
- Synthesize information from several papers on the same topic and
create a coherent presentation on that topic.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 0

Assessment
The assessment will be based on several components:
- Oral presentation (20%): students will (in pairs or small groups,
depending on course enrolment) choose 2-3 papers on a given topic
to present (topics and papers will be selected from a list provided
by the instructor; students may choose a different topic if
approved by the instructor).
- Brief paper responses (25%): For each class other than the one
with their own presentation, students will submit a brief (1
paragraph) summary of the main content of one paper presented that
day, as well as any comments or questions arising from their
reading. Responses will be due on the day of each paper's oral
presentation, so that those students who have written responses can
serve as additional discussants of paper.
- Essay (55%): students will choose an area of cognitive modelling
and write an essay based on one or more articles approved by the
instructor.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>The syllabus consists of two parts. In the first
part, the instructor will provide introductory and background
material, as well as information on how to develop skills in
reading scientific papers and
presenting them. In the second part, students will present papers
on a variety of cognitive models from the literature, chosen from a
list provided by the instructor (or approved by the
instructor).

Topics covered by the instructor will include
- Introduction and overview of modelling
approaches/philosophies.
- Model comparison and evaluation methods.
- Necessary background in probability and information theory.
- How to read, analyse, and present research papers in cognitive
modelling (including general oral presentation skills).
- Example presentation(s) of papers.

Topics available for students to present will vary depending on the
instructor, but will likely emphasize language learning and
processing. Other topics may include visual processing, cognitive
development, categorization, memory, decision-making, reasoning,
and motor control. For specific topics, see the course web page or
contact the instructor directly.</syllabus><transferable_skills>Not entered</transferable_skills><reading_list>There is no main textbook for the course. Readings
