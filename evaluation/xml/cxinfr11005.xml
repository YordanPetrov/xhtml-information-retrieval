between two of the most influential scientific fields. An
appreciation of computational and biological sciences, in
particular the terminology employed in both fields, is essential
for those working at such an interface. In this course, we aim to
cover the following:

* The concepts of computer science that relate to problems in
biological sciences.
* Commercial and academic perspectives on bioinformatics.
* The impact of bioinformatics on the methodologies used in
biological science.
* The influence biological science has on computing science.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Bioinformatics 1

Assessment
Coursework will be assessed through a mini project exploring a
research area of bioinformatics.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>The course will cover the following:
