development of software for embedded systems, from specification
through to validation.
2 - An appreciation of the interplay between the different
requirements in a complex embedded software design, involving
issues such as concurrency, reliability and adherence to timing
constraints.
3 - The ability to compare different specification techniques
through hands-on experience of programming in the Esterel language
as part of the assessed coursework
4 - Comparision of features in high-level languages intended for
embedded software, such as Ada, Esterel, Real-time Java and
