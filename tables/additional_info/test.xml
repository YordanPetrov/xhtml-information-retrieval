    <td width="85%">The syllabus has three parts: theories and
      controversies; cognitive functions; methodology. They are listed
      separately here, but will be presented in an interleaved fashion by
      in the lectures.<br />
      <br />
      1. Basic Concepts<br />
      - representation: digital/analog, dual coding, propositional
      representations<br />
      - computation: tri-level hypothesis, classical/connectionist
      computation<br />
      - interdisciplinarity: disciplines and methodologies contributing
      to cognitive science<br />
      - controversies: modularity, Turing test, neural binding<br />
      <br />
      2. Cognitive functions<br />
      - vision and attention: template matching, feature detection,
      Marr's model, models of attention<br />
      - memory: types of memory, modal model, ACT-R model of memory<br />
      - action: motor control, planning, hierarchical/reactive paradigm
      in robotics<br />
      - reasoning and problem solving: inductive reasoning, reasoning
      paradoxes, models of problem solving, theory formation<br />
      - language: categorization, language acquisition, word recognition,
      semantic representations, NetTalk, Logogen model<br />
      <br />
      3. Methodology<br />
      - neuroscience methods: brain imaging, neuron anatomy, brain
      anatomy<br />
      - experimental design, statistics: between/within subject design,
      levels of measurement, t-test, chi-square test, correlation<br />
      - constructing, criticizing, and evaluating models<br />
      - cognitive architectures: ACT-R<br />
      - neural networks: perceptrons, backproagation, network
      topologies<br />
      - probabilistic models: Bayes rule, Bayes nets<br />
      <br />
      Note that this course is intended to give a high-level introduction
      to the topics listed; subsequent courses (e.g., Cognitive Modeling)
      will then provide a more detailed coverage.
