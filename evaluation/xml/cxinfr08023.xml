as numbers, sets, graphs, and trees)used in computer science.
- Use of mathematical and logical notation to define and formally
reason about mathematical concepts such as sets, relations,
functions, and integers, and discrete structures like trees,
graphs, and partial orders;
- Evaluate elementary mathematical arguments and identify
fallacious reasoning
- Construct inductive hypothesis and carry out simple induction
proofs;
- Use graph theoretic models and data structures to model and solve
some basic problems in Informatics (e.g., network connectivity,
etc.)
- Prove elementary arithmetic and algebraic properties of the
integers, and modular arithmetic, explain some of their basic
applications in Informatics, e.g., to cryptography.
- Compare the asymptotic growth growth rates of basic functions;
derive asymptotic bounds, and limits, for simple series and
recurrence relations. Use these to derive bounds on the resource
consumption (e.g., running time) of simple iterative and recursive
algorithms.
- Calculate the number of possible outcomes of elementary
combinatorial processes such as permutations and
combinations.
- Be able to construct discrete probability distributions based on
simple combinatorial processes, and to calculate the probabilities
and expectations of simple events under such discrete
distributions.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination: 85%
