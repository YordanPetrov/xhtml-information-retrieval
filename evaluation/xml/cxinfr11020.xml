interaction between "self-interested" (or "goal-oriented")
"systems" (or "agents" or "decision makers" or "players"), &amp;
strategic scenarios that arise in such settings. It began life in
Economics in the 1940's with the work of von Neumann &amp;
Morgenstern, but has since been applied to an extraordinary range
of subjects, including political science, evolutionary biology
&amp; even to inspection regimes for arms control.

Game theory has for years also played an important, if less
recognized, role in several branches of computer science.
Applications within computer science include the use of games in
automated verification &amp; model checking to model computing
systems in an unknown and possibly adverse environment. In AI games
are applied to the analysis of multi-agent systems. Recently, with
the advent of the internet and e-commerce, many game theoretic
questions in the interplay between economics &amp; computing have
received extensive attention. These include electronic auctions,
&amp; more generally mechanism design questions (inverse game
theory) related to finding incentive structures for cooperation
between independent entities on the internet.

Wherever game theory plays a quantitative role, algorithmic and
computational questions related to "solving" games are also of
central importance.

This course aims to bring together as a coherent body of knowledge
the game theoretic algorithms &amp; models that underpin several
flourishing subjects at the intersection of computer science,
economics and e-commerce, &amp; AI.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>It is RECOMMENDED that students have passed

Assessment
Students will be given written practical assignments reinforcing
the material taught in class. Some of the practical work may ask
students to implement parts of algorithms for "solving" a game that
arise in one of the application areas.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>* Examples of diverse games.
