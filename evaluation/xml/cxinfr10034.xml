language generation (NLG) investigates how computer programs can be
made to produce high-quality natural language text or speech from
computer-internal representations of information (or other texts).
Motivations for this study range from foundational attempts to
understand how people produce text and speech (linguistic,
psycholinguistic) to entirely practical efforts to produce natural
language output for a wide range of applications, including
automatic explanation from advisory systems, automatic
summarisation from single or multiple documents, machine
translation, dialogue systems, human-robot interaction, tutorial
systems, and many more.

An introduction to the theory and practice of computational
approaches to natural language generation. The course will cover
common approaches to content selection and organization, sentence
planning, and realisation. The course will cover both symbolic
approaches to generation, as well as more recent statistical and
trainable techniques. It also aims to provide: An understanding of
key aspects of human language production; An understanding of
evaluation methods used in this field; Exposure to techniques and
tools used to develop practical systems that can communicate with
users; Insight into open research problems in applications of
natural language generation, e.g., summarization, paraphrase,
dialogue, multimodal discourse.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 2A -

written analysis of how the main theories and algorithms behind NLG
systems have been incorporated into the system, including an
exposition of the theories and algorithms. o Provide the basis for
the evaluation of the system by diagnosing its relations to other
NLG systems, and to human performance data.
2 - Given a simple NLG problem, students should be able to use
computational tools and methodologies to solve it.
3 - Given a current area of NLG research, students should be able
to locate and summarise recent progress in the area.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70
