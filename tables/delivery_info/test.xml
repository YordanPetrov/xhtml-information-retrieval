    <td>1 - Design a small finite-state system to describe, control or
      realise some behaviour.<br />
      2 - Evaluate the quality of such designs using standard engineering
      approaches.<br />
      3 - Apply the algebra of finite automata to design systems and to
      solve simple problems on creating acceptors for particular
      languages.<br />
      4 - Describe simple problems using propositional logic.<br />
      5 - For a given formula in propositional logic, draw a truth table
      for that formula and hence deduce whether that formula is true or
      not.<br />
      6 - Apply a system of proof rules to prove simple propositional
      theorems.<br />
      7 - Describe the range of systems to which finite-state systems and
      propositional logic are applicable and be able to use the meta
      theory to demonstrate the limitations of these approaches in
      concrete situations.
