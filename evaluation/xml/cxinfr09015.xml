to the design and implementation of general purpose multi-tasking
operating systems. It concentrates on the kernel aspects of such
systems with the emphasis being on concepts which lead to practical
implementations. Throughout the course reference is made to a
number of significant actual operating systems (Linux, Windows
variants etc.) to illustrate real implementations.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Successful completion of Year 2 of an Informatics
