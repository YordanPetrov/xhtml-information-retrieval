Computer Animation are covered in this course.

Visualization is a cognitive process using the powerful information
processing and analytical functions of the human vision system. It
has always been a major factor in scientific progress and now, with
the assistance of computer graphics, it extends our vision system
from sub-atomic to interstellar dimensions and allows geometric
representations and simulations of any multidimensional dataset.
The fundamental objective is to acquire new knowledge rather than
generating pictures. This part is very practical and techniques
will be illustrated with applications in the scientific,
engineering and medical domains. The increasingly important field
of information visualisation and visual data-mining will also be
covered.

The computer animation part will focus mainly on technological
aspects for 3D computer animation for applications such as games
and virtual environments. Techniques of character animation such as
synthesizing their body movements, facial expressions and skin
movements, and behaviors in crowded scenes, and how to compress
such data will be first covered. Other topics which are essential
to create natural scenes, such as physically based simulation for
clothes, fluids and particles will also be covered.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites>It is RECOMMENDED that students also take Computer Graphics

Computer Graphics (Level 10) and Human-Computer Interaction (Level
10) are natural components of any computer animation /
visualisation course and they are recommended (but not required) as
companion courses.</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>Yes</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester2, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday>16:10 - 17:00</Friday></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday>16:10 - 17:00</Tuesday><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><first_class>Week 1, Tuesday, 16:10 - 17:00,

Assessment
The course has a single written exam, and two assessed coursework
assignments of equal weighting: one on volume data visualisation
and the other on character animation.

Assessment of outcomes 1-3, 5 and 6 will be primarily through the
written examination, supported by parts of the coursework
assignments. Outcomes 4, 7 and 8 will be assessed through
coursework.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>* Visualisation: definition and motivation.
