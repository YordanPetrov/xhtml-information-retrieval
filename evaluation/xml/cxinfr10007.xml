the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) giving the theoretical
foundation , examples of practical applications and logics for
describing important properties. The course focuses on a
mathematical model of the behaviour of concurrent systems which
treats crucial notions like deadlock and non-determinism, and which
reflects the modular construction of systems. The course also
focuses on specifying safety and liveness properties of such
systems. The approach is a mixture of operational semantics,
algebra and logic. It applies alike to hardware and software.
Although CCS is one of several alternative approaches, the aim is
to treat it in depth rather than to make superficial comparisons
with others.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>It is RECOMMENDED that students have passed

process calculus CCS. The analysis consists of modelling situations
by abstracting away from details and recording their fundamentals
in a small computationally and mathematically appropriate formalism
and then doing the same for their specifications. Finally one
understands how to use all this to increase systems
reliability.
2 - Define behaviour of a system as a transition graph.
3 - Understand when two systems are behaviourally equivalent. as
defined by the notion of bisimulation equivalence.
4 - Verify that two systems are equivalent or prove that they are
not.
5 - Specify temporal properties of systems in the branching time
logic CTL.
6 - Understand the meaning of temporal formulas.
7 - Show that a system has, or fails to have, a temporal
property.
8 - Use tools for systems verification.
9 - Be able to assimilate knowledge about different formalisms and
tools and put them to practical use. Understanding how to apply
mathematical and logical ideas in systems and other computational
contexts.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70

Assessment

Two submissions are required, equally weighted. The first involves
extensive use of the Concurrency Workbench. The second tests
understanding (e.g., of bisimulation); it is a mixture of
exercises, and questions similar to those that may occur in
exams.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>*Modelling communication: media, agents,
