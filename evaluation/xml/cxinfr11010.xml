learning systems, in particular reinforcement learning and
unsupervised methods, particularly as used in RL systems. By the
end of the module the student should have a grasp of modern
learning techniques and the issues involved in dealing with
real-world data. The main techniques covered in the course are
basic reinforcement learning, dynamic programming, Monte Carlo
methods, Q-learning, function approximation, unsupervised and
constructive methods, radial basis and other local functions,
classifier systems as compared to RL systems.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites>It is RECOMMENDED that students also take Natural Computing

techniques.
2 - Insight into the problems involved in applying these techniques
to deal with real world data, and how to overcome those
problems.
3 - Appreciation and identification of suitable learning tasks to
which these learning techniques can be applied
4 - Ability to evaluate how effective a particular learning
procedure has been -- internal indicators of learning success vs.
actual behaviour of the learner.
5 - Use and writing of Matlab programs, ability to set up and run
computational experiments to produce statistically sound
results
6 - Formulation of problems, evaluation of results from the
student's own experiments and those presented in some cases in the
research literature.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 80

Assessment
Two assignments are set, each accounting for 10% of the overall
mark. Typically they require programming a learning system or
experimenting with an existing system, using MATLAB.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>The main topics to be covered are some or all of
