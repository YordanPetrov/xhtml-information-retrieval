The
first part of the course presents the fundamental concepts and
techniques for the generation of simple line and surface drawing
through to the general viewing transformations and
projections.

The second part deals with rendering of realistic, synthetic images
and animation of 3D objects and scenes.

The focus of the course is on algorithms, understanding the
mathematical basis and how you implement rather than simply use in
applications.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Computer Graphics

antialiased lines in Euclidean space
2 - Analyse and synthesise algorithms for the display of space
curves and surfaces of arbitrary smoothness
3 - Model any arbitrary shape of 3D object and to perform
combinations of affine transformations on these objects in 3D
space
4 - Construct views from arbitrary viewpoints in space and project
to an image plane.
5 - Order objects from the viewpoint in order to perform visible
surface computations.
6 - Use surface properties of objects and scene illuminations to
produce realistic images modelling the interaction of light and
objects within a scene.
7 - Calculate the shadows based on the relationship of the lights
and objects.
8 - Simulate the movement of photons to compose realistic
images.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70

Assessment
The course is assessed by a written examination and two generally
unrelated practical exercises each worth 15%.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>*Graphics primitives*: raster display of lines,
