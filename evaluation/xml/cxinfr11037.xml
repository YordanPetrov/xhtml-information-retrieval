the computational mechanisms underlying animal visual systems that
are similar to those of humans. The main emphasis is on how the
properties of neurons across the two-dimensional surface of the
visual cortex are organised topographically to represent and
transform the relevant features of visual stimuli. Because the
visual cortex is the primary model system for understanding the
cortex in general, the course also acts as an introduction to
computational processing in all topographically organised cortical
regions.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>For Informatics and Neuroscience PG and final year
MInf students only, or by special permission of the School.

It is expected that students will have a general background in
computer science, including some programming experience, and will
be comfortable with basic mathematics. Compared to PMR, LFD, and
NC, this course is not as heavily mathematical, focusing more on
biological concepts and computational implementation using existing
primitives. Biological and/or neuroscience background would be very
helpful but is not required. CCN, NIP, and NC are worthwhile
companion or prior courses.</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>Yes</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester2, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday>12:10 - 13:00</Monday><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday>12:10 - 13:00</Thursday><Friday/></time></activity><first_class>Week 1, Monday, 12:10 - 13:00,

There will be two assessed assignments consisting of literature
reviews, modeling project design, and simulations of biological
visual systems using the Topographica simulator.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>*Biological Background
Role of computational models in biology, relation of biological
models to computer vision, early visual processing, primary visual
cortex, face and object processing, visual system development

*Computational Modeling Levels and Approaches
Unit models, topographic map models

*Models of the Development of Feature Maps in V1
E.g. separate and combined maps for topography, orientation, ocular
dominance, motion direction, colour, and spatial frequency

*Modeling Adult Processing in V1
E.g. orientation and motion direction estimation, visual
aftereffects, plasticity, contour segmentation and grouping

*Higher-level Processing
E.g. modeling face detection and recognition, object detection and
recognition, invariant responses (viewpoint, size,
translation)
