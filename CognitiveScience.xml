introduction into cognitive science. It will provide a broad
overview of the subject suitable for all interested students,
including students on the Cognitive Science degrees and external
students.

The aim of the course is to present a unified view of the field,
based on a computational approach to analyzing cognition. The
material is presented grouped by cognitive function, rather than by
subdiscipline.

The course covers vision and attention, memory, motor control and
action, reasoning and problem solving, and language. All topics
will be presented from a computational point of view, and this
perspective will be reinforced by a lab sessions in which students
use implementations of cognitive models. The course will also
provide a basic grounding in cognitive science methodology,
focusing computational modeling, experimental design, and
statistics. Both symbolic and subsymbolic modeling approaches will
be covered.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>None</other_requirements><additional_costs>None</additional_costs></entry_requirements><vs_info><prerequisites>None</prerequisites><visit_students>No</visit_students></vs_info><delivery_info><delivery_period> 2012/13 Semester2, Available to all students (SV1) </delivery_period><learn_enabled>  No</learn_enabled><quota>  None</quota><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday>14:00 - 14:50</Tuesday><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday>14:00 - 14:50</Thursday><Friday/></time></activity><activity><Location>Central</Location><Activity>Lecture</Activity><Description/><time><Monday/><Tuesday/><Wednesday/><Thursday/><Friday>15:00 - 15:50</Friday></time></activity><first_class>Week 1, Tuesday, 14:10 - 15:00,

able to:

- demonstrate knowledge of key areas of cognitive science, and be
able to take an integrated, rather than disciplinary perspective on
the field;
- evaluate the most important conceptual problems in cognitive
science and discuss the solutions that have been proposed;
- analyze and modify simple computational models in a variety of
modeling paradigms;
- demonstrate understanding of experimental design and statistics
and apply it to simple problems in cognitive science.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination - 60%
Assessed Assignments - 40%

There will be three assessed assignments in this course, these will
combine:
- practical exercises in which students are provided with
implemented cognitive models they have to explore and modify
them;
- essay questions in which students analyze empirical or conceptual
problems in cognitive science.

The practical exercises will be supported by lab sessions in which
students learn how to use implemented cognitive models. Where
possible, the assignments will employ pre-existing modeling
tools
(e.g., ACT-R, neural network simulators, probabilistic modeling
tools).

The essay questions will be supported by tutorials in which
students are able to clarify and discuss the materials covered in
the lectures.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>The syllabus has three parts: theories and
controversies; cognitive functions; methodology. They are listed
separately here, but will be presented in an interleaved fashion by
in the lectures.

1. Basic Concepts
- representation: digital/analog, dual coding, propositional
representations
- computation: tri-level hypothesis, classical/connectionist
computation
- interdisciplinarity: disciplines and methodologies contributing
to cognitive science
- controversies: modularity, Turing test, neural binding

2. Cognitive functions
- vision and attention: template matching, feature detection,
Marr's model, models of attention
- memory: types of memory, modal model, ACT-R model of memory
- action: motor control, planning, hierarchical/reactive paradigm
in robotics
- reasoning and problem solving: inductive reasoning, reasoning
paradoxes, models of problem solving, theory formation
- language: categorization, language acquisition, word recognition,
semantic representations, NetTalk, Logogen model

3. Methodology
- neuroscience methods: brain imaging, neuron anatomy, brain
anatomy
- experimental design, statistics: between/within subject design,
levels of measurement, t-test, chi-square test, correlation
- constructing, criticizing, and evaluating models
- cognitive architectures: ACT-R
- neural networks: perceptrons, backproagation, network
topologies
- probabilistic models: Bayes rule, Bayes nets

Note that this course is intended to give a high-level introduction
to the topics listed; subsequent courses (e.g., Cognitive Modeling)
will then provide a more detailed coverage.</syllabus><transferable_skills>Not entered</transferable_skills><reading_list>Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language
