natural and artificial languages, building on material covered in
Informatics 1 concerning finite state machines and regular
expressions. This course will consider how the same models of
language can be used to describe and analyse both formal languages
(such as programming languages) and natural languages (text and
speech). It will include material on formal languages and grammars,
probabilistic grammars (including hidden Markov models), semantic
analysis and human language processing. Examples will be drawn from
computer languages and natural language.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 1 -
