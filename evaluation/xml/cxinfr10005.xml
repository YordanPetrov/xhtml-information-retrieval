introduce the fundamental problems of producing real world
intelligent behaviour in robots, some of the different kinds of
information processing techniques and control architectures that
have been developed, and how biological systems can be modelled on
robots and contribute to their design.

The course is structured around a practical-based programme
involving the development of navigation algorithms on a real robot
platform. We will cover related sensing and control ideas,
approaches, and organisational architectures. We consider some
alternative types of mechanism suggested for the production of
desired intelligent behaviour by both engineers and
biologists.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Introduction to

Assessment
One assignment, carried out in groups of 2 or 3, accounts for 40%
of the course marks. This requires you to program a robot to
perform a specified task, and to present the results in a written
report. The other 10% of the coursework marks will be for
satisfactory completion of the weekly goals towards this task,
demonstrated in each practical session and in short progress
writeups.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>* The problem of designing intelligent autonomous
