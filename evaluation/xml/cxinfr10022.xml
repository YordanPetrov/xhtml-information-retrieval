and professional issues, complementary to the necessary scientific
knowledge and technical skills, that impinge on the work of the
computing professional. The Professional Issues course aims to
provide a general awareness of these issues and to cover some of
them in depth. The course will mostly involve directed reading but
there will be some lectures from members of staff and
visitors.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Successful completion of Year 2 of an Informatics
