efficient, effective and user friendly computing systems depends
upon understanding both the technology and its users. Only then can
designers be confident that computer systems will be properly
matched to the skills, knowledge and needs of their users. The
study of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) seeks to combine
perspectives and methods of enquiry drawn from disciplines such as
Psychology and Sociology with the tools, techniques and
technologies of Computer Science to create an approach to design
which is both relevant and practical.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Human-Computer

problems in HCI.
2 - Demonstrate understanding of human perception and behaviour by
diagnosing problems in relations between work and technology.
3 - Use established design principles and methodologies to solve
HCI problems.
4 - The ability to devise, plan and execute task analysis and
system evaluation studies from an HCI perspective, and present
findings in a clear and effective manner.
5 - Acquire confidence in handling different disciplinary
perspectives on HCI and the ability to apply them to design
problems.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70

Assessment
A group-based exercise involving the re-design and evaluation of a
user interface.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>* Background--the development and scope of HCI.
Practical goals.
* HCI relevant issues in human perception, memory and thinking
processes.
* Approaches to modelling HCI interactions.
* Design methodologies and notations--levels of interface design.
Task analysis, grammars, state charts.
* Techniques and technologies--dialogue styles, information
presentation.
* The design process--user involvement, iterative design,
prototyping. HCI and software engineering.
* Evaluation--methodologies, formative and summative. Performance
and learnability. Specific issues in HCI: the internet; agency;
novel interfaces; ubiquitous computing.
