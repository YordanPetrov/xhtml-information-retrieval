      Assessed Assignments - 40%<br />
      <br />
      There will be three assessed assignments in this course, these will
      combine:<br />
      - practical exercises in which students are provided with
      implemented cognitive models they have to explore and modify
      them;<br />
      - essay questions in which students analyze empirical or conceptual
      problems in cognitive science.<br />
      <br />
      The practical exercises will be supported by lab sessions in which
      students learn how to use implemented cognitive models. Where
      possible, the assignments will employ pre-existing modeling
      tools<br />
      (e.g., ACT-R, neural network simulators, probabilistic modeling
      tools).<br />
      <br />
      The essay questions will be supported by tutorials in which
      students are able to clarify and discuss the materials covered in
      the lectures.</td>
