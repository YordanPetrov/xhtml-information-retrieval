research in linguistics, computer science, and natural language
processing with the aim of introducing students to theoretical and
computational models of language. The course will familiarize
students with a wide range of linguistic phenomena with the aim of
appreciating the complexity, but also the systematic behaviour of
natural languages like English, the pervasiveness of ambiguity, and
how this presents challenges in natural language processing. In
addition, the course introduce the most important algorithms and
data structures that are commonly used to solve many NLP
problems.

The course will cover formal models for representing and analyzing
syntax and semantics of words, sentences, and discourse. Students
will learn how to analyse sentences algorithmically, using
hand-crafted and automatically induced treebank grammars, how to
make monotonic syntactic derivations, and build interpretable
semantic representations. The course will also cover a number of
standard algorithms that are used throughout language processing.
Examples include Hidden Markov Models, the EM algorithm, and state
space algorithms such as dynamic programming.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions>Students MUST NOT also be taking Foundations of

Natural Language sentences and provide a written explanation of how
ambiguity arises in natural language and why this is a problem for
computational analysis.
2 - Given a grammar, semantics and sentence, students should be
able to construct a syntatic and semantic analysis of the
sentence.
3 - Given an appropriate NLP problem, students should be able to
apply sequence models, parsing and search algorithms and provide a
summary of their operation in this context.
4 - Given an appropriate NLP problem, students should be able to
analyse the problem and decide which data structures and algorithms
to apply. ? Review and classify search algorithms and ways of
manipulating dynamic data structures.
5 - Given two NLP algorithms, students should be able to describe
how they are related and illustrate differences and limitations by
providing illustrative examples.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 70

There will be three coursework exercises; one on sequence models,
one on parsing, and one on applying the methods introduced in the
course to an unseen problem.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>Part I: Words
