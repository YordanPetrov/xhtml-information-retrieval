<td width="70%">This course considers the many ways in
which development and maintenance of large software systems differs
from that of small systems. It discusses the high level
architectural decisions that may control the complexity of such
systems,
and the architectural degradation that leads to legacy systems. It
considers the processes by which large systems can be developed and
the role of managers in planning and guiding development,
predicting and mitigating risks, and improving quality.</td>

<tr><td><h2>Summary of Intended Learning Outcomes</h2></td></tr>
<tr><td>1 - Describe and explain the challenges inherent in large-scale
system development and outline techniques with which managers can
help meet these challenges.
2 - Propose and justify architectural decisions for large-scale,
long-lived systems.
3 - Explain why software reuse is difficult, and some approaches
for increasing software reuse.
4 - Summarize and apply approaches for maintaining and replacing
legacy code.
5 - Compare and contrast development processes (e.g. Extreme
Programming and the Unified Process) and explain their application
to a project.
6 - Analyse the significant sources of risk for particular projects
and suggest ways to reduce the risks.
7 - Describe, and in some cases be able to use, tools relevant to
large-scale, long-term development, such as requirements
management, configuration, build, test, and project management
tools.
8 - Critically reflect on given software engineering related
articles, from the peer-reviewed literature and elsewhere.</td></tr>
