representing and interpreting data across the range of informatics.
Students will learn the different perspectives from which data is
used, the different terminology used when referring to them and a
number of representation and manipulation methods. The course will
present a small number of running, illustrative examples from the
perspectives of hypothesis testing and query formation and
answering.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 1 -

in different areas of informatics for collecting, representing and
interpreting data, by being able to apply them to sample
problems.
2 - Demonstrate understanding of different types of data (for
example, structured/semistructured/unstructured,
quantitative/qualitative).
3 - Demonstrate proficiency of the entity/relationship model by
being able to specify appropriate representations and queries for
simple examples.
4 - Show awareness of the importance of logic for the
representation of data by being able to design simple logical
representation of a given data set.
5 - Present data in a variety of forms (textual, graphical,
quantitative), across a range of data types.
6 - Show awareness of the distinction between object data and
meta-data, by being able to apply it to a number of applications
across informatics (e.g., databases, corpora).
7 - Demonstrate knowledge of the basic algorithms for interpreting
and processing data, by being able to demonstrate how these
algorithms work for simple data sets.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 100
