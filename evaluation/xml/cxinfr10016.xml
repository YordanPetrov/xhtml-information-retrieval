maximise performance.
2 - assess the effectiveness of techniques used to enhance the
performance of computer systems.
3 - use web-based simulation models of computer systems to
investigate hardware/software performance trade-offs.
4 - record observations of on-line experiments, present this
information in a variety of formats and draw conclusions from
it.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 75

Assessment
There are three assessed practicals for this module. One of them is
a paper &amp; pencil exercise concerned with interconnection
networks while the other two involve using and programming
simulation models of two different computer systems.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>* Introduction
