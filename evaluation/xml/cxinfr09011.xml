the information base in almost all modern business enterprises and
to electronic commerce. They are also becoming increasingly
important as a fundamental tool in much scientific research. Some
knowledge of databases is now essential in any of these areas. The
study of databases draws on several areas of computer science:
logic, algorithms, programming languages and operating
systems.

This course is an introduction to the principles underlying the
design and implementation of databases and database management
systems. It will cover the languages that have been developed for
relational databases, their implementation and optimisation. It
will also introduce some recent developments in databases including
object-oriented, object-relational systems, semistructured data and
the relationship between databases and XML. The bare essentials of
transaction processing will also be covered.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Successful completion of Year 2 of an Informatics
