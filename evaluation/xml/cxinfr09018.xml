third year is a compulsory part of all AI honours degrees. It is
also compulsory for non-graduating students doing AI honours
modules unless a student only stays at Edinburgh for a short
period. Students on an AI joint ordinary degree do the LP only if
they are not taking the CS group project.

Students are divided up into tutorial groups with a demonstrator
allocated to each group. Tutorial groups will meet at least once a
week at a time of mutual convenience. The LP coordinator and
demonstrators will assist students with the planning and
organisation of their LP.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 2A -

Assessment
No formal written examination; the assessment is based on practical
work and a written report submitted at the end of the project
period.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>* Gentle introduction to the issues and
requirements of the more demanding fourth-year project.
* Experience of reading published papers and identifying their
essential content.
* Exercise of reporting on modest pieces of scientific work:
students have to explain what they did, and why, and what
conclusions they reached, and why, and they have to do this clearly
and convincingly.
* Exercise of peer evaluation.* Experience of writing programs to
investigate specific questions: students must write
well-structured, well-documented programs because they too are acts
of scientific communication.
