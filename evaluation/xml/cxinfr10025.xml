technologies behind search engines, such as Google. The course will
aim to strike a balance between theoretical and system-related
aspects of the field. The course will cover:

1. Theoretical aspects, including properties of text, queries,
relevance, major retrieval models and evaluation;
2. System-related aspects, including crawlers, text processing,
index construction and retrieval algorithms; and
3. Applications, including cross-language and multi-media
search.

The same material will be covered in the level 10 and level 11
versions of the course. Level 11 students should expect more
challenging assignments and an increased programming load.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites>Students MUST have passed: Informatics 2A -

Assessment
There will be a final exam, contributing 70% of the course mark.
The remaining 30% will be assessed through a combination of problem
sets and programming exercises involving application of existing
algorithms and evalution techniques.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>Lectures will cover the following topics, with a
typical lecture integrating material from more than one
aspect.
