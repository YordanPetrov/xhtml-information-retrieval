to the fundamental concepts of the different ways computers can be
analysed and designed. The course does not look at the differences
between machines with different types of instruction set, nor does
it cover design techniques for extracting maximum performance from
computers - these aspects of computer hardware are covered in the
Computer Architecture course. The issues and techniques covered in
the Computer Design course are relevant to the design of all
computers, regardless of their particular architecture.

The course is partitioned into three sections. The short first
section revises the design of combinational and sequential logic.
The second section demonstrates how to analyse and design systems
of the complexity of a simple CPU or I/O controller. The third
section of the course covers the design of a complete computer
capable of executing assembly code programs and different control
strategies for performing I/O.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Successful completion of Year 2 of an Informatics

Assessment
There are four practical exercises for the course. All take place
in the hardware lab. The first exercise introduces students to the
software and hardware to be used by following a design tutorial all
the way through to implementation on a FPGA. The second exercise
gives students familiarity with a sequential logic design
implemented in a programmable microcontroller. The third exercise
requires the design and implementation of the microcode for a
specified cpu data path to build a real computer on the FPGA board
and a final exercise to program the processor to drive some I/O
devices.

If delivered in semester 1, this course will have an option for
semester 1 only visiting undergraduate students, providing
assessment prior to the end of the calendar year.</assessment><special_arrangements>None</special_arrangements><additional_info><academic_description>Not entered</academic_description><syllabus>Logic Design Revision Simple combinational logic
