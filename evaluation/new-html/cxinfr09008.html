<td width="30%">Course description</td>
<td width="70%">The course centres around the
so-called Church-Turing Thesis which proposes that each one of a
variety of different formal systems adequately captures the
intuitive concept of (effective) computability. This thesis implies
that by studying any one of these systems, for example Turing
machines, we can learn about the inherent theoretical limitations
of computers. If a problem cannot be solved by a Turing machine,
then there is no computable solution to it at all.

Not all the computational problems which can be solved in principle
can be solved in practice: the computational resources required
(time or space) may be prohibitive. This observation motivates the
study of resource-bounded computation. Having accepted an extended
version of the Church-Turing thesis (that the computationally
tractable problems are those which can be efficiently solved by a
Turing machine) we are led inevitably to conclude the existence of
natural problems which can be solved in principle but not within
any reasonable resource bound.

The fundamental concepts and techniques encountered in this course
resonate around the whole of Computer Science and indeed beyond:
effective procedures and decidability, simulation methods, machine
encodings and universality, diagonalization arguments, and
reductions between problems.</td>

<tr><td><h2>Summary of Intended Learning Outcomes</h2></td></tr>
<tr><td>1 - Discuss the fundamental nature of computation as a process
(Turing's Thesis).
2 - Discuss the limits to computing both in absolute terms
(unsolvable problems) and practical terms (intractable
problems).
3 - Distinguish different types of languages (recursively
enumerable, recursive etc.).
4 - Demonstrate the solvability of a given problem both in informal
as well as formal terms (use of Turing machines).
5 - Demonstrate the unsolvability of a given problem both in
informal as well as formal terms (use of reductions).
6 - Discuss the classification of solvable problems into tractable
versus intractable ones (P versus NP).
7 - Judge when a problem is likely to be intractable.
8 - Discuss the notion of polynomial time reduction and its
relevance to classifying the relative complexity of problems.
9 - Demonstrate the likely intractability of a given problem by
relating it to other known problems (use of polynomial time
reductions).</td></tr>

<td width="30%">Syllabus</td>
<td width="70%">* Finite state machines: Brief reminder of a model
which does not encompass the intuitive notion of effective
procedure.
* Turing machines: Definition; some programming techniques and
example machines; variants of the Turing machine and their
equivalence.
* The Church-Turing Thesis: Empirical evidence for the Thesis;
equivalence of Turing machines to other models of computation, both
simpler (two-register machines) and more complex (models of
computation which are akin to real computers). Overview of the
basic ideas; proofs are supplied in appendices to the course
notes.
* Universal machines: Encoding Turing machines; a universal Turing
machine.
* Decidability and partial decidability: The Halting Problem;
reductions between problems.
* Nondeterministic Turing machines: Definition and equivalence to
deterministic machines.
* Resource bounded computation: The class P and its interpretation
as the class of computationally tractable decision problems; the
class NP and its interpretation as the class of search problems
with efficiently verifiable solutions.
* NP-completeness: Cook's theorem; examples of problems which are
complete for NP.
* Connections with Logic: Brief introduction to first order and
second order logic and discussion of how the ideas relate to
complexity classes, mainly the NP-complete problems.

<td width="70%">* C.H. Papadimitriou, Computational Complexity,
Addison-Wesley 1994. Useful for those who intend to progress to the
CS4 Computational Complexity module. Includes good discussion of
logic and its connections to computability. An excellent
introduction to most of the concerns of modern day
complexity.
* J.E. Hopcroft, R. Motwani and J.D. Ullman, Introduction to
Automata Theory, Languages and Computation, 3rd edition,
Addison-Wesley 2007. Contains material relevant to this module.
Also proves lower bounds for various problems (e.g., ones connected
with regular expressions).
* M. Minsky, Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines,
Prentice-Hall 1972. An excellent book and strong on motivation.
Unfortunately, it is now only available as an expensive hardback.
There are some copies in the reserve section of the JCMB
library.
* M.R. Garey and D. S. Johnson, Computers and Intractability: A
Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness, Freeman, 1979. A classic
book, strong on motivation covering the latter parts of the module.
A must for those who want to know more as well as the origins of
many of the results and ideas.</td>
