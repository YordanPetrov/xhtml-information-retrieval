to the design and implementation of software systems using
object-oriented techniques. The techniques we consider are oriented
to creating component based designs. The course will review basic
object-oriented techniques and how they support the creation of
component based designs. We also consider the high level modelling
of systems as a means of supporting the Software Engineering
process. Here we study the Unified Modelling Language (UML), which
provides programming language independent notations for
design.</c_description></outline><entry_requirements><prerequisites/><corequisites/><restrictions/><other_requirements>Successful completion of Year 2 of an Informatics

use of available components;
2 - Design simple software components, making sensible API
decisions;
3 - Evaluate and evolve object-oriented software designs, making
use of common design patterns if appropriate;
4 - Create, read and modify UML diagrams documenting designs;
5 - Discuss the use of modelling in software development, e.g. why
and how models of software can have varying degrees of
formality.</learning_outcomes><assessment>Written Examination 100

software development and object-oriented programming, we consider
how object-orientation and the use of components impacts the
development and maintenance of software.
We discuss the use of modelling in software development, including
(i) where models are used purely informally, (ii) where they are
used as reviewed documentation for designs, and (iii) model-driven
development in which models are formal artefacts and code may be
generated from them.
Students learn to document designs in the Unied Modeling Language,
UML, with emphasis on class, sequence and state diagrams and the
Object Constraint Language, OCL.
We study criteria that make one design better than another in
context and introduce design principles and patterns that capture
good practice.</syllabus><transferable_skills>Not entered</transferable_skills><reading_list>* Stevens with Pooley, Using UML: Software
